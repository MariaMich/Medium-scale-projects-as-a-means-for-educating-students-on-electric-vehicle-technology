# Medium scale projects as a means for educating students on electric vehicle technology

All the necessary files and documents collected for the Intermediate Project of the [E-DRIVETOUR](https://www.edrivetour.eu/) Erasmus programme and the according IEEE paper published on the 7th [International Workshop on Microsystems](http://microengineering.iem.ihu.gr/WoMGREECE/index.html) and presented at Dec 14, 2022.

The projects  were a necessary part for the certification process of [ECQA](https://jobcertification.eu/index.php)  and that is why two [OpenSpace3D](https://www.openspace3d.com/) augmented reality apps were created alongside the 3D modelling of two different vehicles with all the relevant technical data and specifications needed for the writing of the academic paper. 

 The projects have been elaborated during its two mobility periods, the first at the premises of the [International Hellenic University](https://www.ihu.gr/en/enhome) in Thessaloniki, Greece and the second
at the [University of Technology and Humanities in Radom](https://uniwersytetradom.pl/?lang=en), Poland. The EDRIVETOUR program focused on educating undergraduate engineering students from different fields of study such as mechanical or electrical engineering, in the
matter of electromobility and modern technologies. During the mobility periods various procedures such as the development of augmented reality applications, collection of technical specifications and datasheets of electric vehicles, 3D modelling and the troubleshooting of a battery assisted Tad-pole tricycle
and a Hybrid Toyota Yaris have been overseen.

## Engine 
The 1NZFXE combined engine 3D design showing the characteristic planetary gear of the power split device of the vehicle and in the front the two alternating current synchronous motors is available in the Toyota Hybrid Engine.stl file. It should be noted that this type of engine is actually used in the Toyota Prius, Prius C, Yaris, Corolla and Sienta models so recreating it in 3D is important for students being able to understand how these vehicles work.

## Battery 
The battery pack of the hybrid vehicle consists of a 12V lead-acid battery, which is located under the right rear side seat and powers all the low voltage devices of the car and is grounded to the metal chassis of the vehicle following most car design principles. The other battery pack with total voltage of 144V is comprised of 20 Nickel Metal Hydride (NiMH) batteries connected in series with each one containing 7.2V and in total weighs 31 kg. It should be noted
that this battery pack is charged only from one three-phase AC electric generator while it provides power back to the electric motor and generator, the inverter or converter as well as the A/C compressor of the hybrid

## Throttle Simulation
The AR application made with OpenSpace3D, simulates a throttle circuit of an electric vehicle
using an Arduino Uno microcontroller as a potentiometer for throttle output and displaying its reading to the OpenSpace3D's user interface. At the same time, another circuit with an Adafruit LCD screen Arduino shield was used to appear the throttle data to the driver in real time allowing for better driving and steering of the vehicle.
