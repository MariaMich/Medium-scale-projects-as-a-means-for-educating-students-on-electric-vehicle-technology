# Medium scale projects as a means for educating students on electric vehicle technology

All the necessary files and documents collected for the Intermediate Project of the Edrivetour Erasmus plus programme and the according IEEE paper published on the
7th International Workshop on Microsystems and presented at Dec 14, 2022.

The Intermediate project was a necessary part for the certification process of the Edrivetour programme and that is why two OpenSpace3D augmented reality apps were created alongside the 3D modelling of two different vehicles with all the relevant technical data and specifications needed for the writing of the academic paper.
