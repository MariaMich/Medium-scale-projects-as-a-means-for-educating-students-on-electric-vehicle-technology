# Medium scale projects as a means for educating students on electric vehicle technology

All the necessary files and documents collected for the Intermediate Project of the Edrivetour Erasmus plus programme and the according IEEE paper published on the
7th International Workshop on Microsystems and presented at Dec 14, 2022.

The Intermediate project was a necessary part for the certification process of the Edrivetour Erasmus plus programme and demanded the creation of two OpenSpace3D augmented reality apps plus the 3D modelling of two different vehicles and the collection of their technical data and specifications and the writing of two academic papers. 

In order to provide transparency of our work in our academic papers we submit all relevant files on this repository. Also someone can download the workshop proceedings along with the paper at this link: http://microengineering.iem.ihu.gr/WoMGREECE2022/2022_WOM_Proceedings.pdf
